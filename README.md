<My Portfolio>

- The motivation behind this project was to create a portfolio page that I can continously update with my projects, and further enhance as my skillsets develop.
- Structured the HTML using semantic elements for easier maitainence. 
- Utilized Flex Box to get the layout I desire. 
- Font size, background color, and image descriptions were added/modified to bring the Accessibility of the page up. 
- In this project I gained a much better grasp of how to properly structure HTML and utilize the various tags, classes, and IDs in my CSS file. I also became a lot more comfortable with using flexbox to layout my boxes on the screen.
